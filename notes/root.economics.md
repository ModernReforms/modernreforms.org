## Preface

For our entire lives, most of us have given no thought to the belief that capitalism is inherently the only logical economic system.

School brainwashes us into thinking that there is no real alternative, without giving us the chance to do our own thought experiments to come to that conclusion on our own. That lack of free thought and reasoning behind the teachings is what creates rebellious teenagers that grow up to be people like Ocasio-Cortez, proposing ideas that lack any true foundation in the real world. These people occasionally have their hearts in the right place, just like AOC, but execution and real-world application are far more relevant than good theoretical ideals.

This ties back to our thoughts on [[Education Reform]], and how Americans (and residents of other nations) are not taught how valuable free-thinkers can be. This does not necessarily reflect the [online definition](https://ffrf.org/component/k2/item/18391-what-is-a-freethinker) and all its connotations, but for the sake of this discussion it might as well.

## Different Systems

### Socialism

- "thumbs" by Sabrina Carter?

## Monopolies

Under our current capitalist system in America, we have allowed the [obvious monopolies](https://marker.medium.com/big-tech-won-the-antitrust-hearings-before-they-even-started-bdb2f613c398) that are Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, to continue to buy their way out of having legal action taken against them.

According to the idea of capitalism, everything should be the choice of the consumer with lax intervention from governments. But how do we handle it when the consumer's choice is taken away by companies that have gotten too big to beat?

- One thing to consider is that Microsoft, an entity with equal claim to fame as the above, has not yet reached this point due to their own choice.
    - They interact with the open source community when they stand to have nothing to financially gain from it
    - They are the only reason Apple still exists, because they did not want the world to end up in the polarized monopolized situation that we currently live in

> Amazon’s logistical efficiency puts every other human entity to shame. Apple’s global supply chain is likely one of the few things that has prevented some sort of aggression with China. Nobody likes oil companies, but if it weren’t for them, we’d all probably be puppet states of Saudi Arabia. Tech companies like Samsung, Facebook, and Google are the ones spearheading internet infrastructure throughout the third world. And the greatest innovations in renewable energies are coming from the private sector.

[This article](https://medium.com/@MarkManson/10-important-lessons-we-learned-from-the-2010s-mark-manson-47a293df2111) made one hell of a solid point. Are monopolies terrible for the workers, competition, and breeding innovation? Sure, but the consumers have benefited like never before. Goods are the most affordable they have ever been (TODO: Fact check), and it's all thanks to these massive corporations.

# Cryptocurrencies

> They have no intrinsic value. You can’t eat it, wear it, or heat your house with it.
