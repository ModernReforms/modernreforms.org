### Modern Reforms for the Modern World 🗺️
As you may well know, our world is at a tipping point in history on a level that has never before been possible. Climate change is even worse than we have been led to believe, currencies and markets around the globe are beginning to fail, and the world is beginning to look more and more like a dystopia.

There might be nothing that can be done about this, we as a species may have let greed control us for too long and we may have gone beyond the point of no return. But Modern Reforms does not believe that this is the end of the world. This is a chance for the people to stand up, be vocal about the changes we want to see in the world, and to elect people who will be responsible for those changes.

Please explore the site, read through the sections that interest you and even the ones that don't, because you may find a new perspective on an issue that you hadn't even considered.

If you have any thoughts that you would like added or any changes that you want made, please either reach out and let us know, or go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meese-enterprises/modernreforms.org) and make them yourself! We would love to hear from you, and we believe that every voice counts and every individual has a unique opinion to offer that has the potential to make a real difference in the world if it is shared with the right people.

Let's work together and save the world! 😄
