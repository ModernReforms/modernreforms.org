> "...psychopaths are able to gain release from prison 2.5 times earlier than their undiagnosed counterparts because of their extraordinary ability to con and charm others. They also re-offend at higher rates." -Susan Lawrence

This is one of the many issues currently associated with the prison system. People who truly need to be locked up are the ones most likely to go free, because they understand the cogs of the machine and can game the system to secure their release. The study was done by Robert Hare, PhD.
