<p>Students should be encouraged to work at their own pace, with teachers serving only as a guiding hand when the student so desires one. Teachers should be meant to answer the questions of students to help them further their knowledge on a subject when the materials available simply can't sate their curiosity, instead of the current system where they determine what's worth learning and steer their pupils in a direction of the teacher's choosing.</p>
<p>One mantra that hits this point home is by SFC McMorrow: "<em>question everything</em>." Students should never be expected to take information at face value, and inquiries into the deeper nature of why things are the way they are and how things work should be encouraged as much as possible. Making their own connections is necessary to forging a lasting relationship with the knowledge and information presented, and the teacher is only there to facilitate their journey in whatever ways they can.</p>

But Modern Reforms does not believe that this is the end of the world. This is a chance for the people to stand up, be vocal about the changes we want to see in the world, and to elect people who will be responsible for those changes.\n\nPlease explore the site, read through the sections that interest you and even the ones that don't, because you may find a new perspective on an issue that you hadn't even considered.\n\nIf you have any thoughts that you would like added or any changes that you want made, please either reach out and let us know, or go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meese-enterprises/modernreforms.org) and make them yourself!
