<p>A suggestion proposed by British philosopher Alain de Botton <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307476820/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=jamesclear-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=0307476820&#x26;linkId=306f4d4e3fd84231369c91cd3be55c76">suggests</a>, the best way to resolve disputes between politicians and party leaders without getting the people riled up for little reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For all the large-scale political solutions which have been proposed to salve ethnic conflict, there are few more effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours than to force them to eat supper together.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds">James Clear</a> goes on to hit on the root of all conflict, explaining why such a solution will be so effective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it is not difference, but distance that breeds tribalism and hostility. As proximity increases, so does understanding. I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln's quote, “I don't like that man. I must get to know him better.” Facts don't change our minds. Friendship does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may seem like the most simplistic, trivial solution to such a large problem in society, and that's because it is. Sometimes excessive complications aren't what society needs; it would benefits us to cut back to the basics and solve the problem at the lowest level, rather than getting a nation involved in something that could be handled over a pizza. Apparently this used to be done by the US Government at an international level via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_banquet">State Banquet</a>, although the practice has died out among domestic meets in favor of more media-friendly debates and rallies.</p>
<p>We can take this even farther, by using a trickle down effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone you know, like, and trust believes a radical idea, you are more likely to give it merit, weight, or consideration. You already agree with them in most areas of life. Maybe you should change your mind on this one too. But if someone wildly different than you proposes an outlandish idea, well, it's easy to dismiss them as a crackpot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the most radical member of a party meets with the second most radical, the second one can potentially convince the first to ease up on some points. Then the third can talk to the second, and so on. If enough people schedule enough dinners, all the problems of America could be adequately addressed within a month. As James says, <code>"You can't jump down the spectrum. You have to slide down it."</code></p>
<p>This was recently proven by a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6428189/">study</a> in the field, and summed up eloquently by <a href="https://markmanson.net/newsletters/mindfck-monday-49">Mark Manson</a> below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, why do we focus so much on our differences? If we’re basically the same 93% of the time, why do we have so much war and bigotry and prejudice and anger over the other 7%? It makes no sense.</p>
