This isn't what education is about. One size *doesn't* fit all, and we need to do a better job of tailoring the experience to the needs of students as individuals and not as one mass group.

The issue that has always been the scapegoat for why we don't do this is funding, but that's one sorry excuse. If funding prevents students from reaching their full potentials, we need to find a way to get more funding, because that is simply unacceptable. We have a duty to give students the best education possible, not the best education we can afford to provide.
