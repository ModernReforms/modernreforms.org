Education is something that nearly everyone, if not *actually* everyone, goes through at some point in their lives. Other than tax reform or some form of a UBI that miraculously works (like [Cicada](https://github.com/the-laughing-monkey/cicada-platform)), there is nothing more macro than education.

It also happens to be one of the things we have the most room to improve in still, and an area where technology is still *extremely* underutilized.
