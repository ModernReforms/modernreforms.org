Teachers should be meant to answer the questions of students to help them further their knowledge on a subject when the materials available simply can't sate their curiosity, instead of the current system where they determine what's worth learning and steer their pupils in a direction of the teacher's choosing.</p>\n<p>One mantra that hits this point home is by SFC McMorrow: \"<em>question everything</em>.\" Students should never be expected to take information at face value, and inquiries into the deeper nature of why things are the way they are and how things work should be encouraged as much as possible. Making their own connections is necessary to forging a lasting relationship with the knowledge and information presented, and the teacher is only there to facilitate their journey in whatever ways they can.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúHe who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.‚Äù ‚Äî Chinese Proverb</p>\n</blockquote>","noteIndex":{"id":"nh36z59hwz1hh7v05wijpxj","title":"Modern Reforms üå±","desc":"Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è","updated":1655664738492,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"about","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"modernreforms.org"},"contentHash":"b6d2ec87fc0dcc918b17b62862dac94e","links":[],"anchors":{"modern-reforms-for-the-modern-world-Ô∏è":{"type":"header","text":"Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è","value":"modern-reforms-for-the-modern-world-Ô∏è","line":8,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":[],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n### Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è\nAs you may well know, our world is at a tipping point in history on a level that has never before been possible. Climate change is even worse than we have been led to believe, currencies and markets around the globe are beginning to fail, and the world is beginning to look more and more like a dystopia.\n\nThere might be nothing that can be done about this, we as a species may have let greed control us for too long and we may have gone beyond the point of no return. But Modern Reforms does not believe that this is the end of the world. This is a chance for the people to stand up, be vocal about the changes we want to see in the world, and to elect people who will be responsible for those changes.\n\nPlease explore the site, read through the sections that interest you and even the ones that don't, because you may find a new perspective on an issue that you hadn't even considered.\n\nIf you have any thoughts that you would like added or any changes that you want made, please either reach out and let us know, or go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meese-enterprises/modernreforms.org) and make them yourself! We would love to hear from you, and we believe that every voice counts and every individual has a unique opinion to offer that has the potential to make a real difference in the world if it is shared with the right people.\n\nLet's work together and save the world! üòÑ\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"modernreforms.org"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["about","economics","education","finances","government","justice","politics","religion","social-media","war","work"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Modern Reforms","description":"Our world is at a tipping point in history on a level that has never before been possible.
