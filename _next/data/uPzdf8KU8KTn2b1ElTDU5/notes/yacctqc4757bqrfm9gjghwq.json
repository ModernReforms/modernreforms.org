Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) aren't paid extra to care, the good ones simply do so because the force is better off for it, and because they care. Teachers should do the same, in aspects both in and out of the classroom.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"nh36z59hwz1hh7v05wijpxj","title":"Modern Reforms üå±","desc":"Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è","updated":1655664738492,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"about","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"modernreforms.org"},"contentHash":"b6d2ec87fc0dcc918b17b62862dac94e","links":[],"anchors":{"modern-reforms-for-the-modern-world-Ô∏è":{"type":"header","text":"Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è","value":"modern-reforms-for-the-modern-world-Ô∏è","line":8,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":[],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n### Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è\nAs you may well know, our world is at a tipping point in history on a level that has never before been possible.

But Modern Reforms does not believe that this is the end of the world. This is a chance for the people to stand up, be vocal about the changes we want to see in the world, and to elect people who will be responsible for those changes.\n\nPlease explore the site, read through the sections that interest you and even the ones that don't, because you may find a new perspective on an issue that you hadn't even considered.\n\nIf you have any thoughts that you would like added or any changes that you want made, please either reach out and let us know, or go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meese-enterprises/modernreforms.org) and make them yourself!
