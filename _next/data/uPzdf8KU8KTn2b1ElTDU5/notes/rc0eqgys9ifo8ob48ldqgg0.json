While our culture currently promotes finding yourself <em>by yourself</em>, that certainly isn't the most effective way to go about it. Your parents understand you better than anyone, having observed you since long before you can remember, and their thoughts are vital to understanding things about yourself that you would never have realized.</p>\n<p>If you don't find yourself in the process, your education was a failure. That is the single most important thing school can help students with, and it is also their weakest point because nobody will focus on something that cannot be standardized and tested for.</p>\n<p>Since it is not feasible to expect every student to have parents with which they have a good enough relationship to make this work, the teacher should assume the role of a parental figure in the education process. The teacher doesn't even need to be a paid educator, the \"teacher\" could be an older student that elects to voluntarily take a younger student under their wing and mentor them. This has the added benefit of helping the older student to explore themselves more introspectively and to also glean a a better understanding of who <em>they</em> are in the process of becoming.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"nh36z59hwz1hh7v05wijpxj","title":"Modern Reforms üå±","desc":"Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è","updated":1655664738492,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"about","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"modernreforms.org"},"contentHash":"b6d2ec87fc0dcc918b17b62862dac94e","links":[],"anchors":{"modern-reforms-for-the-modern-world-Ô∏è":{"type":"header","text":"Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è","value":"modern-reforms-for-the-modern-world-Ô∏è","line":8,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":[],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n### Modern Reforms for the Modern World üó∫Ô∏è\nAs you may well know, our world is at a tipping point in history on a level that has never before been possible.
