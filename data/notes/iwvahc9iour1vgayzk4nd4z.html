<p>Students should be encouraged to work at their own pace, with teachers serving only as a guiding hand when the student so desires one. Teachers should be meant to answer the questions of students to help them further their knowledge on a subject when the materials available simply can't sate their curiosity, instead of the current system where they determine what's worth learning and steer their pupils in a direction of the teacher's choosing.</p>
<p>One mantra that hits this point home is by SFC McMorrow: "<em>question everything</em>." Students should never be expected to take information at face value, and inquiries into the deeper nature of why things are the way they are and how things work should be encouraged as much as possible. Making their own connections is necessary to forging a lasting relationship with the knowledge and information presented, and the teacher is only there to facilitate their journey in whatever ways they can.</p>
