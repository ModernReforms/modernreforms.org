Teachers can take a thing or two from the military in this regard. There is very little attention given to the psychological aspect of schooling, and teachers have no incentive to push students to be more than they currently are.

While the military doesn't get much right, it does push individuals to be better in every aspect of their lives, from spending habits to addictions to healthy eating habits. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) aren't paid extra to care, the good ones simply do so because the force is better off for it, and because they care. Teachers should do the same, in aspects both in and out of the classroom.
