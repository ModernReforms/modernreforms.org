<p>Education is something that nearly everyone, if not <em>actually</em> everyone, goes through at some point in their lives. Other than tax reform or some form of a UBI that miraculously works (like <a href="https://github.com/the-laughing-monkey/cicada-platform">Cicada</a>), there is nothing more macro than education.</p>
<p>It also happens to be one of the things we have the most room to improve in still, and an area where technology is still <em>extremely</em> underutilized.</p>
