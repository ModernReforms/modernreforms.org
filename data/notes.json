Climate change is even worse than we have been led to believe, currencies and markets around the globe are beginning to fail, and the world is beginning to look more and more like a dystopia.\n\nThere might be nothing that can be done about this, we as a species may have let greed control us for too long and we may have gone beyond the point of no return. But Modern Reforms does not believe that this is the end of the world. This is a chance for the people to stand up, be vocal about the changes we want to see in the world, and to elect people who will be responsible for those changes.\n\nPlease explore the site, read through the sections that interest you and even the ones that don't, because you may find a new perspective on an issue that you hadn't even considered.\n\nIf you have any thoughts that you would like added or any changes that you want made, please either reach out and let us know, or go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meese-enterprises/modernreforms.org) and make them yourself! We would love to hear from you, and we believe that every voice counts and every individual has a unique opinion to offer that has the potential to make a real difference in the world if it is shared with the right people.\n\nLet's work together and save the world! 😄\n"

      "body": "\nIn these trying times, it is more prevalent that governments exploit their citizens for their money than it is for them to take actions that benefit the lives of the many. Every single one of my highlights in [this article](https://onezero.medium.com/everything-is-the-hunger-games-now-42161053708a) can point back to this, as our world becomes more and more like the one depicted in Panem.\n\n---\n\nA suggestion proposed by British philosopher Alain de Botton [suggests](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307476820/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jamesclear-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0307476820&linkId=306f4d4e3fd84231369c91cd3be55c76), the best way to resolve disputes between politicians and party leaders without getting the people riled up for little reason:\n\n> “For all the large-scale political solutions which have been proposed to salve ethnic conflict, there are few more effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours than to force them to eat supper together.”\n>\n\n[James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds) goes on to hit on the root of all conflict, explaining why such a solution will be so effective:\n\n> Perhaps it is not difference, but distance that breeds tribalism and hostility. As proximity increases, so does understanding. I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln's quote, “I don't like that man. I must get to know him better.” Facts don't change our minds. Friendship does.\n>\n\nThis may seem like the most simplistic, trivial solution to such a large problem in society, and that's because it is. Sometimes excessive complications aren't what society needs; it would benefits us to cut back to the basics and solve the problem at the lowest level, rather than getting a nation involved in something that could be handled over a pizza. Apparently this used to be done by the US Government at an international level via the [State Banquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_banquet), although the practice has died out among domestic meets in favor of more media-friendly debates and rallies.\n\nWe can take this even farther, by using a trickle down effect:\n\n> If someone you know, like, and trust believes a radical idea, you are more likely to give it merit, weight, or consideration. You already agree with them in most areas of life. Maybe you should change your mind on this one too. But if someone wildly different than you proposes an outlandish idea, well, it's easy to dismiss them as a crackpot.\n>\n\nIf the most radical member of a party meets with the second most radical, the second one can potentially convince the first to ease up on some points. Then the third can talk to the second, and so on. If enough people schedule enough dinners, all the problems of America could be adequately addressed within a month. As James says, `\"You can't jump down the spectrum. You have to slide down it.\"`\n\nThis was recently proven by a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6428189/) in the field, and summed up eloquently by [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/newsletters/mindfck-monday-49) below:\n\n> Yet, why do we focus so much on our differences? If we’re basically the same 93% of the time, why do we have so much war and bigotry and prejudice and anger over the other 7%? It makes no sense.\n>\n"

Climate change is even worse than we have been led to believe, currencies and markets around the globe are beginning to fail, and the world is beginning to look more and more like a dystopia.\n\nThere might be nothing that can be done about this, we as a species may have let greed control us for too long and we may have gone beyond the point of no return. But Modern Reforms does not believe that this is the end of the world. This is a chance for the people to stand up, be vocal about the changes we want to see in the world, and to elect people who will be responsible for those changes.\n\nPlease explore the site, read through the sections that interest you and even the ones that don't, because you may find a new perspective on an issue that you hadn't even considered.\n\nIf you have any thoughts that you would like added or any changes that you want made, please either reach out and let us know, or go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meese-enterprises/modernreforms.org) and make them yourself! We would love to hear from you, and we believe that every voice counts and every individual has a unique opinion to offer that has the potential to make a real difference in the world if it is shared with the right people.\n\nLet's work together and save the world! 😄\n"
